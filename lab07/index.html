    <h1>James Korenman Bio</h1>
    <p>Hi Everybody! My name is James Korenman, and I am a senior in the iSchool studying <strong>information management & technology with a concentration in information security</strong>.  I have always been fascinated in data security, penetration testing, networking, and all things cybersecurity.  I have already had the pleasure of completing two internships doing IT and security for both a visual effects company, and an IT company in my hometown.  Additionally, I am currently working towards receiving my CompTIA Security+ certification, and plan on getting Pen Test+ and Network+ certifications in the near future.  I love to ski, play basketball, golf, and watching movies.  Some of my favorite movies include 2001: A Space Odyssey, Interstellar, and Reservoir Dogs.  I've had some web development experience in the past, but I have forgotten much of it.  I am so excited to re-learn it! 
    </p>
